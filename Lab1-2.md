Experiment 1


Question :- Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice files to use during this lab. In each set, replace X with the numbers 1 through 6. 
Create six files with names of the form songX.mp3, snapX.jpg, filmX.avi. Create three subdirectories for organizing your files, and name the subdirectories 
friends, family, and work. Use a single command to create all three subdirectories at the same time.

Step1:- Creating Multiple Files: The touch command with brace expansion is used to create multiple files efficiently.

Step2:- Creating Multiple Directories: The mkdir command is used to create multiple directories in one go.

Step3:- Verifying Created Files and Directories: The ls command is used to list the created files and directories.
